      A landing page is a standalone web page specifically designed to convert
      visitors into leads or customers. It's the page a user "lands" on after
      clicking a link from an ad, email, or other digital source. Unlike a
      website's homepage, a landing page typically focuses on a single, clear
      call to action, such as signing up for a newsletter, downloading a
      resource, or making a purchase.
