  In 1980, <small>physicist</small> Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN,
  proposed and <strong>prototyped</strong> ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
  researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
  proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.

  [4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in
  late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert
  Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
  formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed
  "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the
  first entry.[5]
